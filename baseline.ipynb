Overview \\nhe W ater Sanitation and Hygiene  National Outcome Routine Mapping ( WASHNORM) is an \\nannual national household and facility -based survey encompassing a comprehensive range of \\nkey outcome indicators and parameters related to the WASH sector . It canvasses households, \\ncommunities, institutions and public places, measuring the level of access to WASH services for different \\nareas and subgroups. It also assesses determinants of sustainability and user perceptions of service \\nlevels, participation and satisfaction with WASH services. The WASHNORM w as developed as a key \\nstrategy by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR) to improve data management and \\navailability of information in the sector for evidence-based planning, decision making, investment \\nmobilization and allocation of resources towa rds improving access to quality and sustainable WASH \\nservices in Nigeria. \\n \\nThe WASHNORM was first conducted in 2018, with the inaugural report launched in May 2019 by the \\nHonourable Minister of Water Resources. This was followed by the second edition of the WASHNORM \\nsurvey, conducted between August 2019 and February 2020 . The report was  launched in November \\n2020. Between May and November 2021 , the third edition of the  WASHNORM survey was \\ncommissioned by the FMWR and the field exercise was successfully implemented by the National Bureau \\nof Statistics (NBS). Given the success of WASHNORM 2019, very little modification was made to the \\nscope and methodology of WASHNORM 2021, however, a few questions were added to the household \\nmodule on COVID 19 . Similarly,  the public utility mapping was expanded to include the energy \\nrequirement of urban waterworks.  \\n \\nThe key objectives of the WASHNORM 2021 are to: \\na. Make available up -to-date, multidimensional and detailed data to support sector -wide \\nplanning, management, informed decision-making and facilitate implementation \\nb. Gain insight from different stakeholders to help  define national WASH sector priorities based \\non the SDG indicators and targets \\nc. Provide and publish routine updates on progress of key sector outcome indicators to inform \\nprogramming and drive performance improvement in WASH services delivery \\nd. Serve as a reference dashboard for systematic monitoring of prog ress towards attainment of \\nkey sector goals and targets \\ne. Serve as a basis for an iterative definition of sector priorities and targets to be used in planning \\nand coordination of interventions and support \\nf. Provide disaggregated data towards addressing structu ral and systemic deprivations and \\ninequities in the distribution of WASH services \\n \\nT ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The detailed methodology of the WASHNORM 2021 survey. \\n3. Key WASH findings, which include demography and household characteristics, general findings \\non WASH services for households, communities, institution and public places  and a summary of \\nthe urban utility mapping. \\n4. Implications of survey findings on policy and practice. \\n \\nII. Methodology \\nThe WASHNORM survey was carried out in all 36 states of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory \\n(FCT), Abuja. Both urban and rural areas were canvassed . Data collection was conducted in the third \\nand fourth quarter of 2021. The data analysis and report compilation were completed in the first quarter \\nof 2022. \\n \\nSampling Methodology \\nThe 2021 WASHNORM  household sampling is nationally representative and was based on a similar \\nsampling strategy adopted under the NORM 2019 and NORM 2018. It used the Enumeration Areas \\n(EAs) as demarcated by the National Population Commission for the 2006 Housing and Population Census \\nand the sampling frame used by the National Integrated Survey of Households (NISH) 2014 -2019. A \\ntwo-stage sampling methodology  was used in selecting the EAs and the households. The first stage \\nrequired updating the sampling frame for the EAs, while the second stage involved the selection of \\nhouseholds listed from each EA selected. The total number of EAs covered was 1,640 EAs in all 36 states \\nplus the FCT; 40 EAs each in 34 states and the FCT, and 120 EAs each in Kano and Lagos states. \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A sample of 15 households per EA was selected systematically using computerized spreadsheets; \\n600 households were canvassed in each of the 34 states and FCT, giving a total of 21,000 households, \\nwhile 1,800 households each were canvassed in Lagos and Kano, giving a grand total of 24,600 \\nhouseholds for all 36 states and the FCT estimated to be surveyed. For the water quality assessment, all \\nwater points within an EA were listed, and 8,200 households were selected out of the 24,600 households \\nusing a systematic approach across the states. \\n \\nSpecific frames were developed for schools, health facilities, urban water utilities , markets and motor \\nparks. The sampling frames were developed from comprehensive lists of institutions provided by the \\nFederal Ministries of Health, Education and Water Resourc es for health facilities, schools, and urban \\nwater utilities, respectively. A total of 2,050 primary and secondary schools and 1,312 health facilities \\nwere listed across the country, while 1,250 markets and motor parks were estimated to be covered. \\n \\nFor the urban water utilities mapping exercise, all 3 6 state and the FCT water agencies (SWAs) and \\npublic urban water utilities or waterworks were targeted and mapped. With regards to the consumer \\nexperience survey, the consumer database was collected from the major public urban water utilities \\nrepresenting each state to form a frame. For each utility, 200 consumers were systematically selected \\nfrom the utility's database to give a total of 7,400 households to be covered. \\n \\nData was collected from about 98.6  % of the targeted samples estimated to be covered from \\nhouseholds and institutions. With regards to the utilities consumers' survey, data was collected from only \\n28 states which had functional and partially functional public urban water utilities. Therefore, a total of \\n5,600 households (i.e. 200 from each of the 28 urban water utilities) was covered out of the targeted \\n7,400.

Therefore, the findings presents national and state level data, \\nbut does not provide local government and community level data. \\n \\nMain Survey Field Data Collection \\nThe 2021 WASHNORM  sampled households who reside in both rural and urban areas across the 36 \\nstates and FCT. Like with previous NORM surveys, data was collected by 533 field personnel through \\nface-to-face interviews with household respondents using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) \\ndevices. The survey collected data from households and facilities in 1,640 enumeration areas selected \\nfrom the 36 states and the FCT. Twelve (12) coordinators, six (6) Controllers, 37 state officers from NBS, \\nand ten (10) resource persons from FMWR, served as trainers for the main survey . They also provided \\na supervisory function for quality assurance of the state-level training exercise and took responsibility \\nfor ensuring that the data collection process was smoothly kick -started with adequate arrangements, \\nincluding intense field monitoring. \\n \\nThe Water Quality survey module was embedded in the stand ardized household questionnaire and \\nrecorded water quality data both at the household's point of collection and consumption or ingestion. To \\nevaluate SDG 6.1, household water safety was assessed based on levels of thermotolerant coliform \\nobserved in the ho usehold water at the point of collection and consumption . The water quality \\nassessments were carried out using Wagtech Palintest Water Quality mobile kits , which were used to \\ncheck for the presence or absence of thermotolerant coliforms. The kit also teste d the severity of \\ncontamination by thermotolerant coliform measured in coliform forming units per 100 ml (CFU/100ml). \\nThe team of enumerators conducting the household survey collected water samples from 6 households \\nper EA selected through systematic random sampling, with one household serving as a negative control \\ntest. \\n \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Altogether, 74 field personnel \\n(two per state) were trained to collect data from the urban water utilities and selected households served \\nby these 28 water utilities. \\n \\nData Quality, Processing and Analysis \\nThe overall response rate for the 2021 WASHNORM  household survey was 98  % from a total of \\n24,600 households sampled. Raw data from the survey tools w ere processed and then edited to \\nascertain accuracy and completeness. Data w ere then analyzed using Statis tical Package for Social \\nSciences (SPSS) and STATA. Key data quality control measures utilized include recruitment and intense \\ntraining of enumerators; the use of mobile data collection techniques with built -in filters and controls to \\nminimize data entry a nd skip pattern errors in the questionnaires; continuous data quality checks of \\nsubmitted data during collection by the NBS data specialists at the country level; and  continuous \\nmonitoring and supervision of all survey process, by coordinators, supervisors , technical specialists and \\nresource persons from NBS, UNICEF and FMWR, both at the field and remotely via dedicated online \\nchat rooms. \\n \\nWith regards to the water utilities mapping exercise, data quality control was carried out through the \\nresource persons and supervisors both on the ground and remotely. This was ensured through the thorough \\nexamination of all information provided by water utilities to ascertain the validity of the information \\nprovided. Enumerators submitted their data daily in line with th e quality assurance requirements . Any \\nerrors and mistakes identified were returned for  re-mapping. GIS-based tools were equally used for \\nquality assurance purposes. \\n \\nIII. Key Findings of the Survey \\nThe findings of the 2021 WASHNORM  provide an analysis of household 's access to basic WASH \\nservices, including quality of drinking water and access and satisfaction levels with water supply services; \\nassessment of water facilities in communities; WASH in schools, hospitals, markets and motor parks; and \\nhousehold expenditure on WASH services. The findings are disaggregated according to the area of \\nresidence, geopolitical zones, states, household wealth quintiles, and other socio-demographic groups to \\nhighlight inequities in access to WASH services across all regions and groups. \\n \\nFor this report, all numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole number (except for values between \\n0 % and 1 %). \\n \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Nearly 8 % of the population \\nare children under five years of age, while 15 % are adults over 50 years. The findings show that 1 in \\n10 households have at least one person living with disabilities, while the proportion of the entire \\npopulation living with disabilities is 6 %, which amounts to about 11 million people in Nigeria living with \\ndisabilities. \\n \\nAt the time of the survey, slightly more than 65  % of households lived in rural areas, while 40  % of \\nhousehold members ranked among the poor to the poorest wealth quintiles. This indicates a moderate \\ndecrease in the number of people i n core rural  by 2 % and a 1 % decrease in household members \\nranked among the poor to the poorest wealth quintiles against the reported value in NORM  2019. \\nFurthermore, from the findings, almost half of the country's population belongs to the poor and poorest \\nwealth quintiles, with 55 % of the rural household members and 9 % of urban household members falling \\nwithin these categories.

Seventy-four \\n(74) % of the household members who suffered diarrhoea cases are children under five. \\n \\nAccess to Water Supply Services \\nUp to 87 % (179 million) of Nigerians do not have access to safely managed drinking water services. \\nAccess to s afely managed drinking water supply services remains inadequate in the North , with the  \\nNortheast having the lowest access at 2 %, while the Southwest has the highest at 29 %. Access for the \\nrural population is at 6 %, four times lower than access levels for the urban population at 27 %. There \\nare also notable differences  in access  between the richest and poorest households. The poorest \\nhouseholds with only 2 % access are 17 times less likely to have access to safely managed water services \\nthan the richest households with 37 % access. \\n \\nAccess to basic water supply services is available to 67 % of the population. At 92 % access levels, the \\nrichest households are twice as likely to use basic water supply services than the poorest households, with \\n46 %.

Eighty-four (84) % of the households expressed \\ndissatisfaction with the level of water supply services primarily because of location and time spent \\nfetching water. \\n \\nAccess to Sanitation Services \\nAccess to sanitation indicators across the country shows a slight improvement, though open defecation is \\nstill prevalent. Evidently, 23 %  of the population (48 million people) still defecate in the open. People \\nin rural areas (31 %) are four times more likely to practice open defecation than those  living in urban \\nareas (8 %). The poorest households (48 %) are 48 times more likely to practice open defecation than \\nthe richest hou seholds (1 %). Forty-six (46) % of the population were found to have access to basic \\nsanitation services in 2021 compared to 44 % in 2019, representing a 2 % (6.9 million people) increase \\nin the number of persons accessing basic sanitation services. Of the number of people using at least a \\nbasic sanitation facility, 18  % use safely managed sanitations services, a three -%age point decrease \\nfrom 2019 findings. Despite the increase in the number of people with access to basic sanitation services, \\nthe proportion of people practising open defecation has barely changed since 2019, with the number \\nincreasing from 46 million in 2019 to 48 million in 2021. \\nOnly 13 % of the population use improved sanitation facilities with a proper handwashing station that \\nhas running water and soap. Fifty-one (51) % of persons living with disabilities find their household 's \\nimproved latrines useable and accessible, while in 33 % of households with latrines, the latrine platforms \\nwere reported as unsafe for children to use. \\n \\nAccess to Hygiene Services \\nThe survey showed a small increase in access to hygiene services between 2019 and 2021 as 17 % of \\nthe population used basic hygiene services in 2021 compared to 16 % in 2019, with notable disparities \\nbetween urban (25 %) and rural (13 %) areas.

The results present a sobering reality \\nthat Nigeria might miss the SDG 6.1 and 6.2 targets by 2030. \\n \\nSustainable and readily available climate -resilient, safely managed WASH services remain a critical \\nneed across the country . The government of Nigeria , through all relevant Ministries, Departments and \\nAgencies (MDAs), will need to adopt innovative and cost -effective approaches to provide safely \\nmanaged WASH services in the country. Government should facilitate and ensure that systems and \\nmechanisms to en sure efficient WASH service delivery are in place to guarantee adequacy, constant \\navailability, and quality of services. \\n \\nOne area that will facilitate the provision of safely managed water and sanitation service at scale is a \\nfunctional urban water and sanitation system through the State Water Agencies (SWAs). As data from \\nthe survey have shown, most of the SWAs are either not functioning or function far below their installed \\ncapacity. Therefore, the d ata presented on the status and quality of these utilit ies should feed into \\ninterventions aimed at enhancing the institutional and operational efficiencies of these public agencies \\nto support the sustainable provision of water and sanitation services. \\n \\nThe dangers of using contaminated water supplies provide sufficient justification for increased focus on \\nwater quality. A conscious effort must be made to combine expansion of access to improved water \\nsources with appropriate practices to ensure that water safety measures that minimize drinking water \\ncontamination from source to the point of use are in place. Water utilities must also be supported with \\nfully equipped and well-funded water quality monitoring and management systems to ensure the quality \\nof water supplied through tap connections is of optimum quality. \\n \\nThere is a need for the expansion in the scope of sanitation service delivery across all levels in the country \\nas well as its coordination and management. To accelerate progress, community influencers, the private \\nsector, and institutions should support government and community efforts to eliminate  open defecation \\nthrough a behaviour change and communication  intervention programme and supply of improved \\nsanitation facilities . Such interventions  should take into cognizance  climate resilience,  environmental, \\npsychological and social factors. Additionally, performance monitoring and knowledge management \\nstrategies should be evolved to sustain all efforts put in by all stakeholders across the three tiers of \\ngovernment. This will contribute to outlined goals and targets and improve the quality and standard of \\nliving of the general populace. \\n \\nThe advent of Covid-19 contributed to slight improvement in handwashing and usage of hand sanitisers. \\nHowever, as the pandemic enters its third year, fatigue has set in, further exacerbated by limited access ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"
